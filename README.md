# VRC-World-Tutorial
 I will  teach you how to make a world, and publish it! All you need is the four of these applications that you NEED!

 1. Steam
 2. VRChat
 3. Unity (You can get it from the creator companions download automatically!)
 4. VRChat Creator Companion

 These four will help you make your first  world in VRChat! Just to know  how, follow these steps.

 Steam: Go to steam's website, download it and  sign in. Next, VRChat: if you have steam installed with an acoount, then you're gonna have to download it on the steam app, and then if you have downloaded it. Make a VRChat  account. VCC: If  you want to make a world/avatar, then you're gonna need to download VRChat's Creator Companion, with the SDK installed. They've also have a feature where you can get the right unity for VCC. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 You're ready with the programs  you've  needed, now all you have to do is to is that you open the  VCC, then go to create project, (If you do not have the unity editor and hub, then you need it install it from VRChat!) Then you select the extensions that you need for your World/avatar. Next, when  they're all selected next you have to open the project you have created.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright! Now, when unity has  finally been loaded, next you need to make your world/avatar. But here's  the thing, you also  need blender or Maya. But the file being  exported  has to be an .fbx! Next, when you have your world/avatar set up, next you will have  to do is  to click on the avatar/world you have created, scroll down  to  componments, and then you have to Add a componment of what the componment of  the  word is called "Descriptor." Next you will then set up the lips and/or eyes to be mastered for VR, next you will go to VRChatSDK/SplashScreen/Build and then autofix everything.

    Once you're done, publish it within  build.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And that is how you make an  avatar/world. Bye!
